Shahnoor Kiani is a London-based security consultant at Rootshell specialising in Application and Cloud Security. He comes from a cloud development background and has been researching applying OSINT techniques to cloud assets with the goal of identifying misconfigured cloud assets exposed to the internet. This interest has led him to research AWS Cognito, since he believes cloud-based identity providers present an emerging threat to companies who do not manage their assets properly.
