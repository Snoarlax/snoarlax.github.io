Shahnoor Kiani is a London-based security consultant at WithSecure specialising in Cloud Security. He comes from a cloud development background and has been researching applying OSINT techniques to cloud assets with the goal of identifying misconfigured cloud assets exposed to the internet. This interest has led him to research AWS Cognito, since he believes cloud-based identity providers present an emerging threat to companies who do not manage their assets properly.

Outside of work he enjoys cooking and baking. He also skates occasionally and enjoys singing and playing the guitar.
